# SpringBootApplication

A spring boot application in which I implement all CRUD operations. Here you can create new students and the application will stores these students into a MySQL
database. All created students will be retrieved from the database and shown on the home page. On the home page you can edit and delete the students. All changes will carry across to the database.
